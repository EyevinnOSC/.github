# Eyevinn Open Source Cloud

[![Slack](http://slack.osaas.io/badge.svg)](http://slack.osaas.io)

We developed and launched Open Source Cloud to reduce the barrier to getting started with open source and at the same time contribute to a sustainable model for open source by giving back a share of the revenue to the creator.

Building solutions based on open source requires that you build, deploy, maintain, and host it yourself. What if it could be as easy that with only a click of a button, you can have it as software as a service? And that there was an easy way to support the creator financially?
